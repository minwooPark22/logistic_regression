##### Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a binary variable that contains data coded as 1 (yes, success, etc.) or 0 (no, failure, etc.)

   ### Logistic regression object in scikit learn has the following hyper parameters
    •penalty='l2',
    •dual=False,
    •tol=0.0001,
    •C=1.0,
    •fit_intercept=True,
    •intercept_scaling=1,
    •class_weight=None,
    •random_state=None,
    •solver='lbfgs',
    •max_iter=100,
    •multi_class='auto',
    •verbose=0,
    •warm_start=False,
    •n_jobs=None,
    •l1_ratio=None,
                    
   ### my parameters
    •penalty='l2',
    •dual=False,
    •tol=0.0001,
    •C=1.21,   // changed
    •fit_intercept=True,
    •intercept_scaling=1,
    •class_weight=None,
    •random_state=0,    //changed
    •solver='lbfgs',
    •max_iter=200,   // changed
    •multi_class='auto',
    •verbose=0,
    •warm_start=False,
    •n_jobs=None,
    •l1_ratio=None,
